### 👋 Hi, I'm Felix!

I’m a passionate teacher living in Berlin, with a love for learning that stretches far beyond the classroom. Coding is my playground—whether it’s web development or fun little automations, I enjoy the challenge and creativity that come with it.

#### What Makes Me Tick:
- 💻 **Coding**: My digital canvas—building, experimenting, problem-solving
- 🎨 **Painting miniatures**: My analog escape with tiny brushes and epic fantasy
- 🌊 **Windsurfing**: Nothing clears the mind like catching the wind
- ☕ **Spending time with friends**: Good conversations and shared creativity fuel me

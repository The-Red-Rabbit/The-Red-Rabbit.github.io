Even though Half-Life 2 is ancient, I decided to flex on my non-existing level design skills. Therefore, I took part in this [Mapping-Challenge](https://www.runthinkshootlive.com/posts/think-tank/). I failed horribly but learned a lot.

You can check out the final results on Moddb [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/map-labs/news/map-lab-4-think-tank-results).

(Above is my modest entry; I would feel very honored when you check it out if you still own Half-Life 2: Episode 2)

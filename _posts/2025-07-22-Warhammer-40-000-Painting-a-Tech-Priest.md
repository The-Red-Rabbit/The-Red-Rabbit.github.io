As promised in [this post]({% post_url 2021-11-18-my-warhammer-40-000-miniatures %}) here are some more images of a miniature I painted recently. A friend of mine is a huge Adeptus Mechanicus fan so I decided to paint a *Tech-Priest Dominus* and gift it to him.

Here you can see the result:

(Unfortunately the pictures were taken in a rush and aren't that good. Next ones will be better I promise.)

Thanks for playing (and for that matter testing it) this prototype in its early stage. At the moment I do not know if and when development will be continued because originally the project started out of boredom of me and my roommate. Nevertheless you are very welcome to suggest ideas for improvement!  
Have a lovely day!

â€¦and here it is! In fact I wanted to try this for a long time:  
The game is featuring **2-Player-Gameplay** by controlling two little humans on their rush to the finish line. But the way is not without obstacles of different kind. Remember: You can only loose and win together!  
Control the character with **W A S D** and **Arrow Keys** with your mate. You will need someone to play with (playing alone is super *hardcore difficulty*) and a suitable internet browser (Chrome recommended) to run the html5-Application.

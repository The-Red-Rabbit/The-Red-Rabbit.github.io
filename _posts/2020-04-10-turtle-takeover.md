Back in the days I was working alongside a good friend from school. One of our first attempts in the realm of gamedesign &amp; -production was: Turtle Takeover

## The original Turtle Takeover

The principle is simple: Fight your way through hordes of alien turtles. We were so excited when we launched and uploaded the game. Some users even took the time to write a comment. You can still play it now on Gamejolt if you follow this link:

## Turtle Takeover revisited

My friend from school courageously signed up for college. He had a assignment due where he revamped the old Turtle Takeover. It is so much better. When I first played it I was blasted. You can see the source code on GitHub and download the game following these links:
